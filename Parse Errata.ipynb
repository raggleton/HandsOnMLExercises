So if the batch size is 32 (which is the default) then there are math.ceil(55000/32)=1719 batches per epoch, so you would see 1213/1719 (instead of 38816/55000).\n",

Every time a new version of Scikit-Learn (or NumPy, Keras, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Pandas) is released, I have to check all the notebooks to ensure they still produce the same output. The most common source of changes is when the default value of some hyperparameter is modified. For example, if the default number of iterations changes, then all the results change. I managed to keep up with this up to now by explicitly setting some of the hyperparameter values to their old default value (or in some cases, to their new default value, when they were announced in advance).

In chapter 3 under Multiclass Classification the author states twice that the stochastic gradient descent classifier (SGDClassifier) can handle multi-class classification problems directly without training multiple binary classifiers using One vs Rest/All. This is listed in the second paragraph as well as one or two pages later. The documentation for the SGDClassifier in sci-kit learn directly contradicts this.

You can think of each step as a queue which waits until a consumer (i.e., the next step) tries to pull elements out of it before it pulls elements from the previous queue.  So it's easier to understand when you start from the end of the pipeline: looking at the code, the prefetch() method pulls from the batch() method, which pulls from the shuffle() method, which pulls rom the map() method, and so on. The batch() method only pulls as many elements as are required to fill the batch, so whether the map() method or the shuffle() method is first makes little difference: in both cases, if the batch size is 32, then only 32 items will be shuffled by the shuffle() method and preprocessed by the map() method (except when pulling the first batch, which requires first filling up the shuffle buffer, in both cases).</td>\n",

One advantage of this approach is that it requires a single big matrix multiplication, rather than multiple small ones, so it is faster, especially on a GPU. Moreover, the concatenation step is not needed in practice, since we don't need to have multiple transformation matrices in the first place: a single big matrix will do (it's a single trainable variable instead of multiple ones).\n",

This new layer is followed by a new output convolutional layer: this is a regular convolutional layer with kernel size 1 that projects the outputs down to the desired number of color channels (e.g., 3).\"\n",
